  "school_story_1_screen_text2": "PLZ_TRANSLATE Money is what is called a legal tender.",
  "school_story_1_screen_text3": "PLZ_TRANSLATE In the past, before there even was money, people exchanged things with each other. It was called barter!",
  "school_story_1_screen_text4": "PLZ_TRANSLATE Have you exchanged something with a friend or sibling?",
  "school_story_1_screen_text5": "PLZ_TRANSLATE If you happened to be good at baking, but wanted meat as well, you could exchange your bread for meat with a butcher.",
  "school_story_1_screen_text6": "PLZ_TRANSLATE Isn't that great?!",
  "school_story_1_screen_text7": "PLZ_TRANSLATE But you couldn't exchange one loaf of bread for just anything, some things were worth more.",
  "school_story_1_screen_text8": "PLZ_TRANSLATE What do you think is worth the most?",
  "school_story_1_screen_text9": "PLZ_TRANSLATE The right answer is:",
  "school_story_1_screen_text10": "PLZ_TRANSLATE The computer!",
  "school_story_1_screen_text11": "PLZ_TRANSLATE If you wanted to exchange bread for something that was worth more, you would have to agree with the other vendor how many loaves of bread it was worth.",
  "school_story_1_screen_text12": "PLZ_TRANSLATE But how would you calculate it?",
  "school_story_1_screen_text13": "PLZ_TRANSLATE Well, the worth of things is usually determined by how expensive the raw materials or parts of it are.",
  "school_story_1_screen_text14": "PLZ_TRANSLATE To bake bread you need flour, yeast, water and maybe some other things.",
  "school_story_1_screen_text15": "PLZ_TRANSLATE Those are the raw materials for bread.",
  "school_story_1_screen_text16": "PLZ_TRANSLATE Another example is fabric and thread to sew clothes. The raw materials for clothes are more expensive than the raw materials for bread.",
  "school_story_1_screen_text17": "PLZ_TRANSLATE But when determining the worth you also have to take into account how hard it is and how long it takes to make.",
  "school_story_1_screen_text18": "PLZ_TRANSLATE ...in our example, it takes longer time to sew a pair of pants than baking a loaf of bread.",
  "school_story_1_screen_text19": "PLZ_TRANSLATE So if you had bread but wanted to barter for a pair of pants, you would have to exchange a couple of loaves for the other person to be satisfied.",
  "school_story_1_screen_text20": "PLZ_TRANSLATE Today, there are also some other things to take into account when you determine or calculate value. But we will talk about that some other time!",
  "school_story_1_screen_text21": "PLZ_TRANSLATE These were the basics to what money and value is.",
  "school_story_2_screen_text1": "PLZ_TRANSLATE It worked to exchange and barter bread for meat and other goods for a while...",
  "school_story_2_screen_text2": "PLZ_TRANSLATE But when people started to travel more, it became a hassle to carry around so much bread.",
  "school_story_2_screen_text3": "PLZ_TRANSLATE And some goods like bread or meat go bad and moldy pretty fast.",
  "school_story_2_screen_text4": "PLZ_TRANSLATE That's why people started using legal tender instead!",
  "school_story_2_screen_text5": "PLZ_TRANSLATE Legal tender is what you give a seller instead of exchanging an item.",
  "school_story_2_screen_text6": "PLZ_TRANSLATE If you bought pants for money, you used legal tender!",
  "school_story_2_screen_text7": "PLZ_TRANSLATE In the past they used some weird things before money was invented. It could be stones, sea shells or whale teeth for example.",
  "school_story_2_screen_text8": "PLZ_TRANSLATE Yeah, you're right, whale teeth sounds a bit grose to keep in your pocket. People were probably relieved when they started making legal tender in silver and gold instead.",
  "school_story_2_screen_text9": "PLZ_TRANSLATE Can you guess what that was?",
  "school_story_2_screen_text10": "PLZ_TRANSLATE The answer is coins!",
  "school_story_2_screen_text11": "PLZ_TRANSLATE When the first coins where made, they made them out of silver or gold. You decided how much the coins were worth by weighing them.",
  "school_story_2_screen_text12": "PLZ_TRANSLATE That's where they saying “Worth its weight in gold“ comes from!",
  "school_story_2_screen_text13": "PLZ_TRANSLATE What do you think, doesn't it seem easier to carry a bag of coins than several sacks of bread?",
  "school_story_2_screen_text14": "PLZ_TRANSLATE Coins were used for a long time, we still do! But when people started to own a lot of coins, it got heavy!",
  "school_story_2_screen_text15": "PLZ_TRANSLATE They were also easy to steal. So banks started storing people's coins in exchange for written receipts.",
  "school_story_2_screen_text16": "PLZ_TRANSLATE When you wanted to buy things, you just paid with the receipts. As the receipts became widely used, they decided to make bills. Those are the same bills we use today.",
  "school_story_2_screen_text17": "PLZ_TRANSLATE It might sound a bit funny, but like I said before, it's us people that have decided how much coins and bills should be worth.",
  "school_story_2_screen_text18": "PLZ_TRANSLATE That's why we can pay with bills even though they are really just pieces of paper, which are cheap to make.",
  "school_story_2_screen_text19": "PLZ_TRANSLATE Yes, so, the bills we use to pay for expensive things...",
  "school_story_2_screen_text20": "PLZ_TRANSLATE ...are made of the same thing as toilet paper!",
  "school_story_3_screen_text1": "PLZ_TRANSLATE Today it's unusal to pay with coins and bills. But when your parents were your age, they couldn´t pay with their phones! They had to pay with cash.",
  "school_story_3_screen_text2": "PLZ_TRANSLATE That's how it was. There were even more coins than today!",
  "school_story_3_screen_text3": "PLZ_TRANSLATE Have you payed with coins or bills in the store?",
  "school_story_3_screen_text4": "PLZ_TRANSLATE Well, today most money is digital. They exist as digits in the bank, you could say. But it's still legal tender.",
  "school_story_3_screen_text5": "PLZ_TRANSLATE Let's pretend you have a 50 piggybucks bill",
  "school_story_3_screen_text6": "PLZ_TRANSLATE If you deposit it in the bank, they will take your bill. But you will still have 50 piggybucks, just in a digital form.",
  "school_story_3_screen_text7": "PLZ_TRANSLATE If you want to use your digital money to buy something, you use a bank card, like the Gimi card!",
  "school_story_3_screen_text8": "PLZ_TRANSLATE You get the card from Gimi or a bank for example.",
  "school_story_3_screen_text9": "PLZ_TRANSLATE Money just doesn't show up in the bank or your account, someone has to deposit them there first.",
  "school_story_3_screen_text10": "PLZ_TRANSLATE When the money is in the account you can't hold them, but it's really the same thing anyway.",
  "school_story_3_screen_text11": "PLZ_TRANSLATE The amount of money you have in your account is called balance.",
  "school_story_3_screen_text12": "PLZ_TRANSLATE It's a little tricky to keep track of your money when you can't hold them in your hand or keep them in a wallet.",
  "school_story_3_screen_text13": "PLZ_TRANSLATE But you can learn how! One way to do so is to make a budget.",
  "school_story_3_screen_text14": "PLZ_TRANSLATE A budget as you might already know is a structure and plan for how much money you have and how much you spend.",
  "school_story_3_screen_text15": "PLZ_TRANSLATE Expenses are what you pay for or buy. Income is the money that you get or earn.",
  "school_story_3_screen_text16": "PLZ_TRANSLATE We will talk more about what a budget is and how to make one in another chapter.",
  "school_story_3_screen_text17": "PLZ_TRANSLATE The most important part is to remember how much you spend...",
