  "school_story_1_screen_text1": "PLZ_TRANSLATE Money is really just pieces of paper. It's us humans who have decided what money should be worth.",
  "school_story_1_screen_text2": "PLZ_TRANSLATE Money is what is called a legal tender.",
  "school_story_1_screen_text3": "PLZ_TRANSLATE In the past, before there even was money, people exchanged things with each other. It was called barter!",
  "school_story_1_screen_text4": "PLZ_TRANSLATE Have you exchanged something with a friend or sibling?",
  "school_story_1_screen_text5": "PLZ_TRANSLATE If you happened to be good at baking, but wanted meat as well, you could exchange your bread for meat with a butcher.",
  "school_story_1_screen_text6": "PLZ_TRANSLATE Isn't that great?!",
  "school_story_1_screen_text7": "PLZ_TRANSLATE But you couldn't exchange one loaf of bread for just anything, some things were worth more.",
  "school_story_1_screen_text8": "PLZ_TRANSLATE What do you think is worth the most?",
  "school_story_1_screen_text9": "PLZ_TRANSLATE The right answer is:",
  "school_story_1_screen_text10": "PLZ_TRANSLATE The computer!",
  "school_story_1_screen_text11": "PLZ_TRANSLATE If you wanted to exchange bread for something that was worth more, you would have to agree with the other vendor how many loaves of bread it was worth.",
  "school_story_1_screen_text12": "PLZ_TRANSLATE But how would you calculate it?",
  "school_story_1_screen_text13": "PLZ_TRANSLATE Well, the worth of things is usually determined by how expensive the raw materials or parts of it are.",
  "school_story_1_screen_text14": "PLZ_TRANSLATE To bake bread you need flour, yeast, water and maybe some other things.",
  "school_story_1_screen_text15": "PLZ_TRANSLATE Those are the raw materials for bread.",
  "school_story_1_screen_text16": "PLZ_TRANSLATE Another example is fabric and thread to sew clothes. The raw materials for clothes are more expensive than the raw materials for bread.",
  "school_story_1_screen_text17": "PLZ_TRANSLATE But when determining the worth you also have to take into account how hard it is and how long it takes to make.",
  "school_story_1_screen_text18": "PLZ_TRANSLATE ...in our example, it takes longer time to sew a pair of pants than baking a loaf of bread.",
  "school_story_1_screen_text19": "PLZ_TRANSLATE So if you had bread but wanted to barter for a pair of pants, you would have to exchange a couple of loaves for the other person to be satisfied.",
  "school_story_1_screen_text20": "PLZ_TRANSLATE Today, there are also some other things to take into account when you determine or calculate value. But we will talk about that some other time!",
  "school_story_1_screen_text21": "PLZ_TRANSLATE These were the basics to what money and value is.",
  "school_story_2_screen_text1": "PLZ_TRANSLATE It worked to exchange and barter bread for meat and other goods for a while...",
  "school_story_2_screen_text2": "PLZ_TRANSLATE But when people started to travel more, it became a hassle to carry around so much bread.",
  "school_story_2_screen_text3": "PLZ_TRANSLATE And some goods like bread or meat go bad and moldy pretty fast.",
  "school_story_2_screen_text4": "PLZ_TRANSLATE That's why people started using legal tender instead!",
  "school_story_2_screen_text5": "PLZ_TRANSLATE Legal tender is what you give a seller instead of exchanging an item.",
  "school_story_2_screen_text6": "PLZ_TRANSLATE If you bought pants for money, you used legal tender!",
  "school_story_2_screen_text7": "PLZ_TRANSLATE In the past they used some weird things before money was invented. It could be stones, sea shells or whale teeth for example.",
  "school_story_2_screen_text8": "PLZ_TRANSLATE Yeah, you're right, whale teeth sounds a bit grose to keep in your pocket. People were probably relieved when they started making legal tender in silver and gold instead.",
  "school_story_2_screen_text9": "PLZ_TRANSLATE Can you guess what that was?",
  "school_story_2_screen_text10": "PLZ_TRANSLATE The answer is coins!",
  "school_story_2_screen_text11": "PLZ_TRANSLATE When the first coins where made, they made them out of silver or gold. You decided how much the coins were worth by weighing them.",
  "school_story_2_screen_text12": "PLZ_TRANSLATE That's where they saying “Worth its weight in gold“ comes from!",
  "school_story_2_screen_text13": "PLZ_TRANSLATE What do you think, doesn't it seem easier to carry a bag of coins than several sacks of bread?",
  "school_story_2_screen_text14": "PLZ_TRANSLATE Coins were used for a long time, we still do! But when people started to own a lot of coins, it got heavy!",
  "school_story_2_screen_text15": "PLZ_TRANSLATE They were also easy to steal. So banks started storing people's coins in exchange for written receipts.",
  "school_story_2_screen_text16": "PLZ_TRANSLATE When you wanted to buy things, you just paid with the receipts. As the receipts became widely used, they decided to make bills. Those are the same bills we use today.",
  "school_story_2_screen_text17": "PLZ_TRANSLATE It might sound a bit funny, but like I said before, it's us people that have decided how much coins and bills should be worth.",
  "school_story_2_screen_text18": "PLZ_TRANSLATE That's why we can pay with bills even though they are really just pieces of paper, which are cheap to make.",
  "school_story_2_screen_text19": "PLZ_TRANSLATE Yes, so, the bills we use to pay for expensive things...",
  "school_story_2_screen_text20": "PLZ_TRANSLATE ...are made of the same thing as toilet paper!",
  "school_story_3_screen_text1": "PLZ_TRANSLATE Today it's unusal to pay with coins and bills. But when your parents were your age, they couldn´t pay with their phones! They had to pay with cash.",
  "school_story_3_screen_text2": "PLZ_TRANSLATE That's how it was. There were even more coins than today!",
  "school_story_3_screen_text3": "PLZ_TRANSLATE Have you payed with coins or bills in the store?",
  "school_story_3_screen_text4": "PLZ_TRANSLATE Well, today most money is digital. They exist as digits in the bank, you could say. But it's still legal tender.",
  "school_story_3_screen_text5": "PLZ_TRANSLATE Let's pretend you have a 50 piggybucks bill",
  "school_story_3_screen_text6": "PLZ_TRANSLATE If you deposit it in the bank, they will take your bill. But you will still have 50 piggybucks, just in a digital form.",
  "school_story_3_screen_text7": "PLZ_TRANSLATE If you want to use your digital money to buy something, you use a bank card, like the Gimi card!",
  "school_story_3_screen_text8": "PLZ_TRANSLATE You get the card from Gimi or a bank for example.",
  "school_story_3_screen_text9": "PLZ_TRANSLATE Money just doesn't show up in the bank or your account, someone has to deposit them there first.",
  "school_story_3_screen_text10": "PLZ_TRANSLATE When the money is in the account you can't hold them, but it's really the same thing anyway.",
  "school_story_3_screen_text11": "PLZ_TRANSLATE The amount of money you have in your account is called balance.",
  "school_story_3_screen_text12": "PLZ_TRANSLATE It's a little tricky to keep track of your money when you can't hold them in your hand or keep them in a wallet.",
  "school_story_3_screen_text13": "PLZ_TRANSLATE But you can learn how! One way to do so is to make a budget.",
  "school_story_3_screen_text14": "PLZ_TRANSLATE A budget as you might already know is a structure and plan for how much money you have and how much you spend.",
  "school_story_3_screen_text15": "PLZ_TRANSLATE Expenses are what you pay for or buy. Income is the money that you get or earn.",
  "school_story_3_screen_text16": "PLZ_TRANSLATE We will talk more about what a budget is and how to make one in another chapter.",
  "school_story_3_screen_text17": "PLZ_TRANSLATE The most important part is to remember how much you spend...",
  "school_story_3_screen_text18": "PLZ_TRANSLATE ...and calculate how much you have left. Then you can keep track of your money even if it's digital.",
  "school_story_4_screen_text1": "PLZ_TRANSLATE Like I said in the previous chapter, the price depends on how expensive raw materials are and how long it takes to make",
  "school_story_4_screen_text2": "PLZ_TRANSLATE But it is only part of the truth.",
  "school_story_4_screen_text3": "PLZ_TRANSLATE Because the price of a product also depends on other things.",
  "school_story_4_screen_text4": "PLZ_TRANSLATE Products, as you may know, is the word for things that you can buy.",
  "school_story_4_screen_text5": "PLZ_TRANSLATE Let’s practice!",
  "school_story_4_screen_text6": "PLZ_TRANSLATE A product is...?",
  "school_story_4_screen_text7": "PLZ_TRANSLATE The right answer is:",
  "school_story_4_screen_text8": "PLZ_TRANSLATE A thing you can buy!",
  "school_story_4_screen_text9": "PLZ_TRANSLATE Except the raw materials and time it takes to make, it is also something called supply and demand that can affect the price.",
  "school_story_4_screen_text10": "PLZ_TRANSLATE How much there is of something or how easy it is to get is called:",
  "school_story_4_screen_text11": "PLZ_TRANSLATE Supply",
  "school_story_4_screen_text12": "PLZ_TRANSLATE How many that want the product or how much people want it is called:",
  "school_story_4_screen_text13": "PLZ_TRANSLATE Demand",
  "school_story_4_screen_text14": "PLZ_TRANSLATE You will learn more about supply and demand in the next story but I want to talk more about price and value right now.",
  "school_story_4_screen_text15": "PLZ_TRANSLATE Cost and value are a bit different.",
  "school_story_4_screen_text16": "PLZ_TRANSLATE The cost is what you pay for the product. The price of it.",
  "school_story_4_screen_text17": "PLZ_TRANSLATE The price is often calculated by adding the cost for raw materials and time it takes to make, and then that is affected by the supply and demand that I talked about.",
  "school_story_4_screen_text18": "PLZ_TRANSLATE But value and worth is a little more complicated.",
  "school_story_4_screen_text19": "PLZ_TRANSLATE Maybe you have heard people say that something was 'worth the cost' or 'worth paying for.'",
  "school_story_4_screen_text20": "PLZ_TRANSLATE But what do they actually mean when they say that?",
  "school_story_4_screen_text21": "PLZ_TRANSLATE To understnad value better you have to start by learning that there are two kinds of value; subjective value and objective value.",
  "school_story_4_screen_text22": "PLZ_TRANSLATE Wow, those were also difficult words!",
  "school_story_4_screen_text23": "PLZ_TRANSLATE I will explain these words and then you will get to practice in the challenge before I teach you more.",
  "school_story_4_screen_text24": "PLZ_TRANSLATE Something is subjective when you see it from your own point of view. When you have an opinion about it.",
  "school_story_4_screen_text25": "PLZ_TRANSLATE So subjective value is if you think an icecream is worth 30pb for example.  You might think that a varm summer day, but not in the middle of winter.",
  "school_story_4_screen_text26": "PLZ_TRANSLATE Something is objective when you see it from a point of view that is not personal. So it usually is about facts and not about peoples opinion and what people think.",
  "school_story_4_screen_text27": "PLZ_TRANSLATE The objective value is often pretty close to the price of a product, otherwise it can be hard get people to buy it.",

  "school_story_5_screen_text8": "PLZ_TRANSLATE But in the spring apples are not in season. Then maybe they have to be imported from other countries.",
  "school_story_5_screen_text9": "PLZ_TRANSLATE Then the sellers can make the price higher because people will buy them anyway, and can’t pick them at home.",
  "school_story_5_screen_text10": "PLZ_TRANSLATE With demand it’s the opposite. If many people want something…",
  "school_story_5_screen_text11": "PLZ_TRANSLATE …the sellers can make the price higher.",
  "school_story_5_screen_text12": "PLZ_TRANSLATE But if the demand is low and not that many want to buy the product…",
  "school_story_5_screen_text13": "PLZ_TRANSLATE …they have to lower the price to try and make people buy it.",
  "school_story_5_screen_text14": "PLZ_TRANSLATE An example for demand is when a gaming company is selling a new console. When they release a new one they can set a high price because many want it.",
  "school_story_5_screen_text15": "PLZ_TRANSLATE But then they also have to lower the price of the old ones because less people want to buy the old models when there is a new one.",

  "school_story_5_screen_text17": "PLZ_TRANSLATE If the supply is high the price is low. \nIf the demand is high the price is high.",

  "school_story_6_screen_text4": "PLZ_TRANSLATE I will start by asking you: Do you think it is good to buy something expensive?",
  "school_story_6_screen_text5": "PLZ_TRANSLATE Difficult question! Because something can be expensive because it costs a lot of money, or just more expensive than it usually is.",
  "school_story_6_screen_text6": "PLZ_TRANSLATE If you can afford something that costs a lot, but it is more expensive than it usually is, its better to wait for a better price.",
  "school_story_6_screen_text7": "PLZ_TRANSLATE How do you really know if something is cheap or expensive?",
  "school_story_6_screen_text8": "PLZ_TRANSLATE The easiest answer is that you do it through knowing the price the things you buy often. Then you know what they usually cost and can compare.",
  "school_story_6_screen_text9": "PLZ_TRANSLATE If you are buying something you don't know the price of, you can go to different stores and check it.",
  "school_story_6_screen_text10": "PLZ_TRANSLATE Now a days, with internet it's fast!",
  "school_story_6_screen_text11": "PLZ_TRANSLATE When you try to decide if something is cheap or expensive, it's almost always about comparing prices and products.",
  "school_story_6_screen_text12": "PLZ_TRANSLATE You can compare between products that are tsimilar in some way. \nAnd you can compare prices of the same product in different stores.",
  "school_story_6_screen_text13": "PLZ_TRANSLATE To find out if you think a price of a product is okey you can compare it to other products as well.",
  "school_story_6_screen_text14": "PLZ_TRANSLATE We will do an example to explain it the best!",
  "school_story_6_screen_text15": "PLZ_TRANSLATE Pretend that you want to buy french fries at a food stand, but want to compare if they want a fair price for them.",
  "school_story_6_screen_text16": "PLZ_TRANSLATE They also sell pizza and ice cream at the food stand.",
  "school_story_6_screen_text17": "PLZ_TRANSLATE They sell the french fries for 50pb. To compare you then look at the price for pizza and ice cream as well.",
  "school_story_6_screen_text18": "PLZ_TRANSLATE A pizza should be more expensive than french fries. The ice cream should be cheaper. Do you know why?",
  "school_story_6_screen_text19": "PLZ_TRANSLATE Yes, well, the pizza is worth more, because the raw materials are more expensive and it takes more time and effort to make it.",
  "school_story_6_screen_text20": "PLZ_TRANSLATE And the ice cream should be cheaper for the same reason, and the ice cream is also a smaller portion of food than the ice cream or pizza.",
  "school_story_6_screen_text21": "PLZ_TRANSLATE In this food stand they want 85pb for a pizza. \nThe ice cream is 26pb.",
  "school_story_6_screen_text22": "PLZ_TRANSLATE Are the prices fair when you compare the products?",
  "school_story_6_screen_text23": "PLZ_TRANSLATE Yes they are! The ice cream is the cheapest, the pizza is the most expensive and the french fries are between them in price.",
  "school_story_6_screen_text24": "PLZ_TRANSLATE But then you still don't know so much about if it is cheap or expensive...",
  "school_story_6_screen_text25": "PLZ_TRANSLATE Then, you can also compare prices of the same product in different stores. So you could check in the food stands close what a portion of french fries costs.",
  "school_story_6_screen_text26": "PLZ_TRANSLATE The food stand where you were first, wanted 50pb. In the food stand next to it they want 67pb for french fries.",
  "school_story_6_screen_text27": "PLZ_TRANSLATE The food stand closest was the cheapest! \n But, as you know, sometimes you choose between price and value.",
  "school_story_6_screen_text28": "PLZ_TRANSLATE Because if you know that the more expensive food stand have tastier french fries and larger portions, you might buy the more expensive ones, because then it's worth it!",
