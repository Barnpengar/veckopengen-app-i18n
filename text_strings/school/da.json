  "school_story_1_screen_text1": "PLZ_TRANSLATE Money is really just pieces of paper. Its us humans who have decided what money should be worth.",
  "school_story_1_screen_text2": "PLZ_TRANSLATE Money is what is called a legal tender.",
  "school_story_1_screen_text3": "PLZ_TRANSLATE In the past, when there was no money, people exchanged things with eachother. It was called barter!",
  "school_story_1_screen_text4": "PLZ_TRANSLATE Have you possibly exchanged something with a friend or sibling?",
  "school_story_1_screen_text5": "PLZ_TRANSLATE If you were good at baking bread and lived in a village in the past, but wanted meat as well, you could exchange your bread for meat with a butcher.",
  "school_story_1_screen_text6": "PLZ_TRANSLATE Good right?!",
  "school_story_1_screen_text7": "PLZ_TRANSLATE But you couldn't exchange one loaf of bread for just anything, some things were worth more.",
  "school_story_1_screen_text8": "PLZ_TRANSLATE What do you think is worth more?",
  "school_story_1_screen_text9": "PLZ_TRANSLATE The right answer is:",
  "school_story_1_screen_text10": "PLZ_TRANSLATE The diamond!",
  "school_story_1_screen_text11": "PLZ_TRANSLATE If you wanted to exchange bread for something that was worth more, you would have to agree with the other vendor how many loaves of bread it was worth.",
  "school_story_1_screen_text12": "PLZ_TRANSLATE But how would you calculate it?",
  "school_story_1_screen_text13": "PLZ_TRANSLATE Well, the worth of things is usually determined by how expensive the raw materials or parts of it are.",
  "school_story_1_screen_text14": "PLZ_TRANSLATE To bake bread you need flour, jeast, water and maybe some other things.",
  "school_story_1_screen_text15": "PLZ_TRANSLATE Those are the raw materials for bread.",
  "school_story_1_screen_text16": "PLZ_TRANSLATE Another example is fabric and thread to sew clothes. And the raw materials for clothes are more expensive than the raw materials for bread.",
  "school_story_1_screen_text17": "PLZ_TRANSLATE But when determining the value you also have to take into account how hard it is and how long it takes to make.",
  "school_story_1_screen_text18": "PLZ_TRANSLATE ...in our example, it takes longer time to sew a pair of pants than baking a loaf of bread.",
  "school_story_1_screen_text19": "PLZ_TRANSLATE So if you had bread but wanted to barter for a pair of pants, you would have to exchange a couple of loaves for the other person to be satisfied.",
  "school_story_1_screen_text20": "PLZ_TRANSLATE Today, there are also some other things to take into account when you determine or calculate value. But we will talk about that some other time!",
  "school_story_1_screen_text21": "PLZ_TRANSLATE These were the basics to what money and value is.",
  "school_story_2_screen_text1": "PLZ_TRANSLATE It worked to exchange and barter bread for meat and other good a while..",
  "school_story_2_screen_text2": "PLZ_TRANSLATE But when people started to travel more, it started to be a hassle to have so much bread with you.",
  "school_story_2_screen_text3": "PLZ_TRANSLATE And some goods like bread or meat go bad and moldy pretty fast.",
  "school_story_2_screen_text4": "PLZ_TRANSLATE Thats why people started using legal tender instead!",
  "school_story_2_screen_text5": "PLZ_TRANSLATE Legal tender is what you give a seller instead of exchanging an item.",
  "school_story_2_screen_text6": "PLZ_TRANSLATE If you bought pants for money, you used legal tender!",
  "school_story_2_screen_text7": "PLZ_TRANSLATE In the past they used some weird things before money was invented. It could be stones, sea shells or whale teeth for example.",
  "school_story_2_screen_text8": "PLZ_TRANSLATE Yeah, you are right, whaleteeth in your pocket sounds a bit grose. I think people where happy when they started making legal tender in silver and gold instead.",
  "school_story_2_screen_text9": "PLZ_TRANSLATE Can you guess what that was?",
  "school_story_2_screen_text10": "PLZ_TRANSLATE The aswer is coins!",
  "school_story_2_screen_text11": "PLZ_TRANSLATE When the first coins where made, they where made out of silver or gold. They decided how much the coins where worth by weighing them.",
  "school_story_2_screen_text12": "PLZ_TRANSLATE That's where they saying 'Worth its weight in gold' comes from!",
  "school_story_2_screen_text13": "PLZ_TRANSLATE What do you think, doesnt it seem easier to carry a bag of coins than a wagon of bread?",
  "school_story_2_screen_text14": "PLZ_TRANSLATE Coins where used for many many years, we still do! But when people started to have a lot of money it was also heave to carry coins.",
  "school_story_2_screen_text15": "PLZ_TRANSLATE They where also easy to steal. So banks started exchanging coins for written receipts.",
  "school_story_2_screen_text16": "PLZ_TRANSLATE You could then buy things, paying with the receipts. There where more and more receipts, so they decided to make bills, bills like we also have today.",
  "school_story_2_screen_text17": "PLZ_TRANSLATE Correct! It might sound a bit funny, but its us people that have decided how much coins and bills should be worth.",
  "school_story_2_screen_text18": "PLZ_TRANSLATE Thats why we can pay with bills even though they actually just are pieces of paper that are cheap to make.",
  "school_story_2_screen_text19": "PLZ_TRANSLATE Yes.. the bills we use to pay for expensive things..",
  "school_story_2_screen_text20": "PLZ_TRANSLATE Are mode of the same thing as toiletpaper!",
  "school_story_3_screen_text1": "PLZ_TRANSLATE Today it is unusal to pay with coins and bills. But when your parents were your age, there wasn't even swish! They had to pay with cash.",
  "school_story_3_screen_text2": "PLZ_TRANSLATE Thats how it was. There were even more coins than today!",
  "school_story_3_screen_text3": "PLZ_TRANSLATE Have you payed with coins or bills in the store?",
  "school_story_3_screen_text4": "PLZ_TRANSLATE Well, today most money is digital. They exist as digits in the bank, you could say. But it is still legal tender.",
  "school_story_3_screen_text5": "PLZ_TRANSLATE Lets pretend you have a 50 pb bill",
  "school_story_3_screen_text6": "PLZ_TRANSLATE If you deposit it in the bank, they will take your bill. But you will still have 50 piggybucks, just in a digital form.",
  "school_story_3_screen_text7": "PLZ_TRANSLATE If you want to use your digital money to buy something, you use a bankcard, like Mastercard",
  "school_story_3_screen_text8": "PLZ_TRANSLATE You get the card from for example Gimi or a bank.",
