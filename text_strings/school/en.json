  "school_story_midpoint_subtitle": "Yo! You are already half way through. Nice!",
  "school_story_end1_title": "Ready for the challenge?",
  "school_story_end1_subtitle": "Good job! Now you can do the challenge to test what you learned. Remember that you can always redo the story if you dont recall everything.",
  "school_story_1_screen_text1": "Money is really just pieces of paper. Its us humans who have decided what money should be worth.",
  "school_story_1_screen_text2": "Money is what is called a legal tender.",
  "school_story_1_screen_text3": "In the past, when there was no money, people exchanged things with eachother. It was called barter!",
  "school_story_1_screen_text4": "Have you possibly exchanged something with a friend or sibling?",
  "school_story_1_screen_text5": "If you were good at baking bread and lived in a village in the past, but wanted meat as well, you could exchange your bread for meat with a butcher.",
  "school_story_1_screen_text6": "Good right?!",
  "school_story_1_screen_text7": "But you couldn't exchange one loaf of bread for just anything, some things were worth more.",
  "school_story_1_screen_text8": "What do you think is worth more?",
  "school_story_1_screen_text9": "The right answer is:",
  "school_story_1_screen_text10": "The diamond!",
  "school_story_1_screen_text11": "If you wanted to exchange bread for something that was worth more, you would have to agree with the other vendor how many loaves of bread it was worth.",
  "school_story_1_screen_text12": "But how would you calculate it?",
  "school_story_1_screen_text13": "Well, the worth of things is usually determined by how expensive the raw materials or parts of it are.",
  "school_story_1_screen_text14": "To bake bread you need flour, jeast, water and maybe some other things.",
  "school_story_1_screen_text15": "Those are the raw materials for bread.",
  "school_story_1_screen_text16": "Another example is fabric and thread to sew clothes. And the raw materials for clothes are more expensive than the raw materials for bread.",
  "school_story_1_screen_text17": "But when determining the value you also have to take into account how hard it is and how long it takes to make.",
  "school_story_1_screen_text18": "...in our example, it takes longer time to sew a pair of pants than baking a loaf of bread.",
  "school_story_1_screen_text19": "So if you had bread but wanted to barter for a pair of pants, you would have to exchange a couple of loaves for the other person to be satisfied.",
  "school_story_1_screen_text20": "Today, there are also some other things to take into account when you determine or calculate value. But we will talk about that some other time!",
  "school_story_1_screen_text21": "These were the basics to what money and value is.",
  "school_story_2_screen_text1": "It worked to exchange and barter bread for meat and other good a while..",
  "school_story_2_screen_text2": "But when people started to travel more, it started to be a hassle to have so much bread with you.",
  "school_story_2_screen_text3": "And some goods like bread or meat go bad and moldy pretty fast.",
  "school_story_2_screen_text4": "Thats why people started using legal tender instead!",
  "school_story_2_screen_text5": "Legal tender is what you give a seller instead of exchanging an item.",
  "school_story_2_screen_text6": "If you bought pants for money, you used legal tender!",
  "school_story_2_screen_text7": "In the past they used some weird things before money was invented. It could be stones, sea shells or whale teeth for example.",
  "school_story_2_screen_text8": "Yeah, you are right, whaleteeth in your pocket sounds a bit grose. I think people where happy when they started making legal tender in silver and gold instead.",
  "school_story_2_screen_text9": "Can you guess what that was?",
  "school_story_2_screen_text10": "The aswer is coins!",
  "school_story_2_screen_text11": "When the first coins where made, they where made out of silver or gold. They decided how much the coins where worth by weighing them.",
  "school_story_2_screen_text12": "That's where they saying 'Worth its weight in gold' comes from!",
  "school_story_2_screen_text13": "What do you think, doesnt it seem easier to carry a bag of coins than a wagon of bread?",
  "school_story_2_screen_text14": "Coins where used for many many years, we still do! But when people started to have a lot of money it was also heave to carry coins.",
  "school_story_2_screen_text15": "They where also easy to steal. So banks started exchanging coins for written receipts.",
  "school_story_2_screen_text16": "You could then buy things, paying with the receipts. There where more and more receipts, so they decided to make bills, bills like we also have today.",
  "school_story_2_screen_text17": "It might sound a bit funny, but its us people that have decided how much coins and bills should be worth.",
  "school_story_2_screen_text18": "Thats why we can pay with bills even though they actually just are pieces of paper that are cheap to make.",
  "school_story_2_screen_text19": "Yes.. the bills we use to pay for expensive things..",
  "school_story_2_screen_text20": "Are mode of the same thing as toiletpaper!",
  "school_story_3_screen_text1": "Today it is unusal to pay with coins and bills. But when your parents were your age, there wasn't even swish! They had to pay with cash.",
  "school_story_3_screen_text2": "Thats how it was. There were even more coins than today!",
  "school_story_3_screen_text3": "Have you payed with coins or bills in the store?",
  "school_story_3_screen_text4": "Well, today most money is digital. They exist as digits in the bank, you could say. But it is still legal tender.",
  "school_story_3_screen_text5": "Lets pretend you have a 50 pb bill",
  "school_story_3_screen_text6": "If you deposit it in the bank, they will take your bill. But you will still have 50 piggybucks, just in a digital form.",
  "school_story_3_screen_text7": "If you want to use your digital money to buy something, you use a bankcard, like Mastercard",
  "school_story_3_screen_text8": "You get the card from for example Gimi or a bank.",
  "school_story_3_screen_text9": "Money just doesn't show up in the bank or your account, someone has to deposit them there first.",
  "school_story_3_screen_text10": "When the money is in the account you can't hold them, but its really the same thng anyway.",
  "school_story_3_screen_text11": "The amount of money you have in your account is called balance.",
  "school_story_3_screen_text12": "It is a bit harder to keep track of your money when you cant hold them or keep them in a wallet.",
  "school_story_3_screen_text13": "But you can learn hoow, for example you can make a budget.",
  "school_story_3_screen_text14": ".. a budget as you might know is a plan for how much money and what expenses you have.",
  "school_story_3_screen_text15": "Expenses are what you pay for or buy. Income is the money that you get or earn.",
  "school_story_3_screen_text16": "More abouth what a budget is and how to make one, we will talk about in another chapter.",
  "school_story_3_screen_text17": "The most important part is to remember how much you spend...",
  "school_story_3_screen_text18": "And calculate how much you have left. Then you kan keep track even if your money is digital.",
