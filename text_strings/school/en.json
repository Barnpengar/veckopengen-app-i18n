  "school_story_1_screen_text1": "PLZ_COPY Money is really just pieces of paper. It's us humans who have decided what money should be worth.",
  "school_story_1_screen_text2": "PLZ_COPY Money is what is called a legal tender.",
  "school_story_1_screen_text3": "PLZ_COPY In the past, before there even was money, people exchanged things with each other. It was called barter!",
  "school_story_1_screen_text4": "PLZ_COPY Have you exchanged something with a friend or sibling?",
  "school_story_1_screen_text5": "PLZ_COPY If you happened to be good at baking, but wanted meat as well, you could exchange your bread for meat with a butcher.",
  "school_story_1_screen_text6": "PLZ_COPY Isn't that great?!",
  "school_story_1_screen_text7": "PLZ_COPY But you couldn't exchange one loaf of bread for just anything, some things were worth more.",
  "school_story_1_screen_text8": "PLZ_COPY What do you think is worth the most?",
  "school_story_1_screen_text9": "PLZ_COPY The right answer is:",
  "school_story_1_screen_text10": "PLZ_COPY The diamond!",
  "school_story_1_screen_text11": "PLZ_COPY If you wanted to exchange bread for something that was worth more, you would have to agree with the other vendor how many loaves of bread it was worth.",
  "school_story_1_screen_text12": "PLZ_COPY But how would you calculate it?",
  "school_story_1_screen_text13": "PLZ_COPY Well, the worth of things is usually determined by how expensive the raw materials or parts of it are.",
  "school_story_1_screen_text14": "PLZ_COPY To bake bread you need flour, yeast, water and maybe some other things.",
  "school_story_1_screen_text15": "PLZ_COPY Those are the raw materials for bread.",
  "school_story_1_screen_text16": "PLZ_COPY Another example is fabric and thread to sew clothes. The raw materials for clothes are more expensive than the raw materials for bread.",
  "school_story_1_screen_text17": "PLZ_COPY But when determining the worth you also have to take into account how hard it is and how long it takes to make.",
  "school_story_1_screen_text18": "PLZ_COPY ...in our example, it takes longer time to sew a pair of pants than baking a loaf of bread.",
  "school_story_1_screen_text19": "PLZ_COPY So if you had bread but wanted to barter for a pair of pants, you would have to exchange a couple of loaves for the other person to be satisfied.",
  "school_story_1_screen_text20": "PLZ_COPY Today, there are also some other things to take into account when you determine or calculate value. But we will talk about that some other time!",
  "school_story_1_screen_text21": "PLZ_COPY These were the basics to what money and value is.",
  "school_story_2_screen_text1": "PLZ_COPY It worked to exchange and barter bread for meat and other goods for a while...",
  "school_story_2_screen_text2": "PLZ_COPY But when people started to travel more, it became a hassle to carry around so much bread.",
  "school_story_2_screen_text3": "PLZ_COPY And some goods like bread or meat go bad and moldy pretty fast.",
  "school_story_2_screen_text4": "PLZ_COPY That's why people started using legal tender instead!",
  "school_story_2_screen_text5": "PLZ_COPY Legal tender is what you give a seller instead of exchanging an item.",
  "school_story_2_screen_text6": "PLZ_COPY If you bought pants for money, you used legal tender!",
  "school_story_2_screen_text7": "PLZ_COPY In the past they used some weird things before money was invented. It could be stones, sea shells or whale teeth for example.",
  "school_story_2_screen_text8": "PLZ_COPY Yeah, you're right, whale teeth sounds a bit grose to keep in your pocket. People were probably relieved when they started making legal tender in silver and gold instead.",
  "school_story_2_screen_text9": "PLZ_COPY Can you guess what that was?",
  "school_story_2_screen_text10": "PLZ_COPY The answer is coins!",
  "school_story_2_screen_text11": "PLZ_COPY When the first coins where made, they made them out of silver or gold. You decided how much the coins were worth by weighing them.",
  "school_story_2_screen_text12": "PLZ_COPY That's where they saying 'Worth its weight in gold' comes from!",
  "school_story_2_screen_text13": "PLZ_COPY What do you think, doesn't it seem easier to carry a bag of coins than several sacks of bread?",
  "school_story_2_screen_text14": "Coins where used for a long time, we still do! But when people started to own a lot of coins, it got heavy!",
  "school_story_2_screen_text15": "They where also easy to steal. So banks started storing people's coins in exchange for written receipts.",
  "school_story_2_screen_text16": "When you wanted to buy things, you just paid with the receipts. As the receipts became widely used, they decided to make bills. Those are the same bills we use today.",
  "school_story_2_screen_text17": "It might sound a bit funny, but like I said before, it's us people that have decided how much coins and bills should be worth.",
  "school_story_2_screen_text18": "That's why we can pay with bills even though they are really just pieces of paper, which are cheap to make.",
  "school_story_2_screen_text19": "Yes, so, the bills we use to pay for expensive things...",
  "school_story_2_screen_text20": "...are made of the same thing as toilet paper!",
  "school_story_3_screen_text1": "Today it's unusal to pay with coins and bills. But when your parents were your age, they couldnÂ´t pay with their phones! They had to pay with cash.",
  "school_story_3_screen_text2": "That's how it was. There were even more coins than today!",
  "school_story_3_screen_text3": "Have you payed with coins or bills in the store?",
  "school_story_3_screen_text4": "Well, today most money is digital. They exist as digits in the bank, you could say. But it's still legal tender.",
  "school_story_3_screen_text5": "Let's pretend you have a 50 piggybucks bill",
  "school_story_3_screen_text6": "If you deposit it in the bank, they will take your bill. But you will still have 50 piggybucks, just in a digital form.",
  "school_story_3_screen_text7": "If you want to use your digital money to buy something, you use a bank card, like Mastercard",
  "school_story_3_screen_text8": "You get the card from Gimi or a bank for example.",
  "school_story_3_screen_text9": "Money just doesn't show up in the bank or your account, someone has to deposit them there first.",
  "school_story_3_screen_text10": "When the money is in the account you can't hold them, but it's really the same thing anyway.",
  "school_story_3_screen_text11": "The amount of money you have in your account is called balance.",
  "school_story_3_screen_text12": "It's a little tricky to keep track of your money when you can't hold them in your hand or keep them in a wallet.",
  "school_story_3_screen_text13": "But you can learn how! One way to do so is to make a budget.",
  "school_story_3_screen_text14": "A budget as you might already know is a structure and plan for how much money you have and how much you spend.",
  "school_story_3_screen_text15": "Expenses are what you pay for or buy. Income is the money that you get or earn.",
  "school_story_3_screen_text16": "We will talk more about what a budget is and how to make one in another chapter.",
  "school_story_3_screen_text17": "The most important part is to remember how much you spend...",
  "school_story_3_screen_text18": "...and calculate how much you have left. Then you can keep track of your money even if it's digital.",
