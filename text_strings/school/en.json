  "school_story_1_screen_text3": "In the past, when there was no money, people exchanged things with eachother. It was called barter!",
  "school_story_1_screen_text4": "Have you possibly exchanged something with a friend or sibling?",
  "school_story_1_screen_text5": "If you were good at baking bread and lived in a village in the past, but wanted meat as well, you could exchange your bread for meat with a butcher.",
  "school_story_1_screen_text6": "Good right?!",
  "school_story_1_screen_text7": "But you couldn't exchange one loaf of bread for just anything, some things were worth more.",

  "school_story_1_screen_text13": "Well, the worth of things is usually determined by how expensive the raw materials or parts of it are.",

  "school_story_1_screen_text15": "Those are the raw materials for bread.",
  "school_story_1_screen_text16": "Another example is fabric and thread to sew clothes. And the raw materials for clothes are more expensive than the raw materials for bread.",
  "school_story_1_screen_text17": "But when determining the value you also have to take into account how hard it is and how long it takes to make.",
  "school_story_1_screen_text18": "...in our example, it takes longer time to sew a pair of pants than baking a loaf of bread.",
  "school_story_1_screen_text19": "So if you had bread but wanted to barter for a pair of pants, you would have to exchange a couple of loaves for the other person to be satisfied.",
