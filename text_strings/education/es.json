The most expensive might not automatically be the best, equally cheapest can sometimes be a false economy if they aren’t as well-made, they may not last as long.

  "save_chapter_6_step_1_idea": "PLZ_TRANSLATE Talk about where your child keeps their money, this may be in several places, e.g. Gimi App; cash in the house; other savings accounts etc. Knowing how much money you have is important, as it allows you to make plans about what you have to spend, plans about saving up for something important and to know if you can afford to buy something when you want.",

Start with just the 1 and 2 pence pieces and then add in the 5p; 10p and 20p.  It will help if you have lots of pennies, so that you can explain that the 2p = 2 x 1p etc.",

  "spend_chapter_7_step_3_idea": "PLZ_TRANSLATE This may take a lot of practice.  Use lots of pennies to help explain. You could play a board game such as ‘Pop to the Shops’ or ‘Buy it Right’ which teach about paying and receiving change.
